1. First, we need to add and save the following XML in the /tmp/isolated.xml file. If the 192.168.254.0/24 network is already in use elsewhere on our network, we can choose a different network.

...
<network>
<name>isolated</name>
<ip address='192.168.254.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
<dhcp>
<range start='192.168.254.2' end='192.168.254.254'/>
<host mac='52:54:00:56:1e:09'name='BSPWM'ip='192.168.254.2'/>
</dhcp>
</ip>
</network>
...

# Note: Change mac address, VM name and Static IP address to your requirement

2.  Then create the network with the following command:

virsh net-define /tmp/isolated.xml

3. After that, we need to set the network to autostart with the following command:

virsh net-autostart isolated

4. And start the network with the following command:

virsh net-start isolated

5. Now, edit the configuration of each guest that uses macvtap for its network connection using the following command:

virsh edit name_of_guest

Add a new <interface> in the <devices> section similar to the following (note the <model type=’virtio’/> line is optional to include):

...
<interface type='network' trustGuestRxFilters='yes'>
<source network='isolated'/>
<model type='virtio'/>
</interface>

6. Finally, shut down, then restart each of these guests.

Since this new network is isolated to only the host and guests, all other communication from the guests will use the macvtap interface.
